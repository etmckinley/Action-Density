# Action-Density
Example code to produce action density plots from StatsBomb event data using R.

These plots were adapted from [@danzn1](https://twitter.com/danzn1/status/1161380572087947265?s=20).

This code will produce density plots like these:

The data used for this example comes from [StatsBomb's free event data](https://github.com/statsbomb/StatsBombR).
